Welcome to my GitHub Repository

- 👋 I’m Gil Estes, an independent software developer and consultant. My GitHub and Twitter handle is @TheTwoNotes.
- 👀 I’m interested in native iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI, but also have a fairly vast experience in core Java technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently delving deeper into SwiftUI and the ever evolving capabilities it presents.
- 🌲 On a personal side, I'm very interested in Climate Change and all things Renewable.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most anything iOS related, but if you have other technology needs, I hope you'll reach out.
- 📫 You can reach me through my business website at: [BGE Software Contacts](https://bgesoftware.com/contact-us/)

I'll look forward to hearing from you!

- Why @TheTwoNotes? I am also a trained musician and it is music and technology that makes up the two lietmotiffs of what I do.
